            Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies
            is that we train novice students and also make them work on Live
            projects. Web design refers to the design of websites that are
            displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience
            aspects of website development rather than software development. Web
            design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop
            browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet
            browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

            is that we train novice students and also make them work on Live
            projects. Web development is the work involved in developing a
            website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
            network). Web development can range from developing a simple single
            static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
            businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
            engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
            client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web professionals,
            "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
            building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may
            use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier
            and available with basic technical skills.

          <h3>App Development</h3>
          <p class="fs-5 text-justify">
            Something which makes PN INFOSYS different from other IT companies
            is that we train novice students and also make them work on Live
            projects. Mobile app development is the act or process by which a
            mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital
            assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These
            software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as
            a smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be
            pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered
            as web applications using server-side or client-side processing
            (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience
            within a web browser. Application software developers also must
            consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and
            configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and
            changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has
            been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst
            report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within
            the EU then 28 members (including the UK), 60 percent of which are
            mobile app developers.
